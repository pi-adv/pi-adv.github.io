	<h1 style="text-align: center;">Welcome to Cybertitan EDU</h1>
	<p>Cybertitan EDU is a side project developed by a team captain in the Canadian Cybertitan competition. This whole website is meant to be the foundation of resources and 
		stratagies to hopefully qualify for competitions. This project is made for members and people who want to learn or have a look at what Cybertitan is about. This project began
		in early July and has been going strong ever since.
	</p>
	<h2>Cybersecurity and Cybertitans</h2>
	<p>Cybertitans is about cybersecurity and how you can develop and find fixes for issues on a computer. It's all virtual and set up by the American Air Force. What's so great 
		about competiting is solving with your team and facing challenges. The whole competition does a really great job at giving everyone an authentic experience. Cybersecurity 
		does demand a few things, which scales with how much you are willing to put into it. I found Cybersecurity amuzing and great to tinker around with. Others find it fun 
		to be around the people. It's based around Cybersecurity but it's much more.
	</p>
	<h2>Tips for the Site</h2>
	<p>This site has gone through quite a few renovations and hopefully will be in a semi-solid state for the time being. There is a couple of sections to take not of, the 
		<a href="../Hypernova/Hypernova.html">Hypernova</a> section. This section has a broken down version of the blog post from Hypernova if you really want to read information. The 
		<a href="../Chapters/Chapters.html">Chapters</a> section consists of 5 chapters spanning from Windows, Ubuntu, Packet Tracer and Script learning to the capacities that I know of. 
		(These will be updated periodically with new information). The <a href="../Tools/Tools.html">Tools</a> Section contains the beef and a main purpose of the site, because it holds 
		all of the practice images that are great to prepare yourself for competition. Finally, the <a href="../Tools/Answer_Keys.html">Answer Key</a> section goes along with the practice 
		images and where your can look for yourself the answers for certain practice images. Feel free to go to the github and either open an issue if there is something that is not working correctly.
	</p>
	<h2>Plans for 2024/2025</h2>
	<p>The plans are going to be on this site but also on the Teams for team members. Certain events will happen including a Clash of the Titans and some other events making their 
		debut this year. Competitions for this year is only 4 hours long.

	<h2>After the 24-25 Season</h2>
	<p>
		After the 24-25 season I would have to say that it has been a success. The amount of pure information and learning that we have done is something that could never to traded.
		It's unfortunate that we couldn't make it to semis and according to the sheets, we were still 53 points off from making it. Even with such a great year we still needed a little bit more.
		We have a couple of more teams next year that will hopefully take everything from this year and improve. 
	</p>
	<p>
		Our results really show everything we were the best in New Brunswick with our second team following us by 64 points. If I could give any advice to anyone next year doing Cybertitans, 
		it's to never quit and keep pushing thourhg even it's a huge pit of learning it's all worth it in the end!
	</p>

	<h2>What's Next??</h2>
	<p>I suggest exploring the site and taking a look at what it has to offer. The plan is to keep up the site as long as possible. Good luck to you all, piadv :>.</p>
