	<h1>Introduction</h1>
	<p>This section is all about teaching you the very basics
	of cybersecurity, but also how the Cybertitans setup and
	compete.</p>

	<h2>What is Cybersecurity?</h2>
	<p>Cybersecurity put simply is the way of securing some electronic 
	from being hacked from something that is not authorized. This is 
	the foundation of Cybersecurity, protecting what we have and
	keeping the people that shouldn't have it, out.</p>

	<p>If I were to ask, what's the first thing that comes to mind 
	when asking to protect an account? Most would say a password.
	Already if you have passwords on any of your accounts, you
	have practiced cybersecurity in a way.</p>

	<p>This is fantastic because to learn the next steps, you are
	not only making passwords, but building a strong wall to keep
	people out and away from getting it.</p>

	<h2>What is the Cybertitans?</h2>
	<p>The cybertitans is a competition that has been running for
	over a decade. Teams are signed up and compete in competitions
	over the course of the year to try and win the finals. The 
	teams range across Canada being seperated in two catagories.
	1. Middle School,
	 2. High School/Open. We compete in the High School/Open which
	means we compete against every other High School and any team 
	that is in the Open division.</p>

	<p>We compete in at least 3 competitions.</p>
	<ol>
		<li>Round 1 (24-25 Season --> (October 24-27))</li>
		<li>Round 2 (24-25 Season --> (November 14-17))</li>
		<li>State Round (24-25 Season --> (December 12-15))</li>
	</ol>
	<p>These 3 comptitions are considered as the QUALIFYING rounds.
	Since your points are combined to see if you qualify for 
	the next few rounds.</p>
	<ol>
		<li>SemiFinals (24-25 Season --> (January 23-25))</li>
		<li>National Finals (24-25 Season --> (March 14-18))</li>
	</ol>
	<p>The other rounds will only take a number of teams from each
	league.<p><a href="leagues.html">Visit here to learn more.</a>
