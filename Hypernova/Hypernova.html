	<p>If you want to check the pure blog itself go to <a href="https://akshayrohatgi.com/blog/posts/How-To-Win-CyberPatriot/" target="_blank">this website.</a></p>
		
	<p>I will be breaking this down to be more applicable to our teams.</p>

	<h2 id="Preface">Section 0 - Preface</h2>
	<p>First off, addressing the misconceptions of Cyberpatriot and the competition
	themselves. Many competitiors describe Cyberpatriot as a Windows and Linux
	system-hardening competition. Which is semi-correct. How Hypernova describes Cyberpatriot
	is a high school incident response and remediation competition.</p>
	<p>Secondly, the other misconception of the competition is the 
	need to catch all of the vulnerabilities. Which this problem is
	described as simply created scripts and checklists and throwing 
	it at the image, hoping for some points to be knocked out of it,
	saying that these vulnerabilities are stored in a CyberPatriot 
	Vulnerability Bank that we make in our own minds and checklists.
	Hypernova states that it's not completely wrong to do this but
	it is not the most effective way to approach a competition.</p>

	<h2 id="AtC">Section 1 - Approaching the Competition</h2>
	<p>Hypernova stated that they are not releasing their notes
	with the checklists and practices that they used. This makes 
	complete sense but they do give some tips to develop our
	own checklist and practices.</p>
	
	<h4>Method 1 - Research</h4>
	<p>Research is crucial to a Cybertitan team. Hypernova even
	specifies that research is important before, during and after 
	the competition. The way you research is also specified, this being
	that you SHOULD NOT just google settings for a service than 
	pasting those random settings. This practice should be used 
	but we have never really used it. What's recommended to do is to 
	search up these settings but also apply the settings, by
	setting up an environnment and then fooling around with the 
	setting and configurations that you should have found.</p>

	<p>Researching effectively is extremely important. Hypernova
	says during competition you will encounter something that 
	will be messed with or thrown at you that won't work. They
	suggest you develop skills to be able to search effectively
	for any critical service.</p>

	<p>Keeping note of what you struggled with and then finding
	out how to solve the issue you couldn't figure out in 
	competition. Hypernova helpfully provided a list of critical
	services that we should look into and know how to configure.</p>
	
	<p>These services include:</p>
	<ol>
		<li>HTTP/S Services</li>
		<ul>
			<li>Apache2</li>
			<li>IIS</li>
		</ul>
		<li>DNS Services</li>
		<ul>
			<li>Windows DNS</li>
			<li>Bind9</li>
		</ul>
		<li>Remote Management Services</li>
		<ul>
			<li>OpenSSH</li>
			<li>RDP</li>
		</ul>
		<li>Database Technology</li>
		<ul>
			<li>MySQL/MariaDB</li>
			<li>MSSQL</li>
		</ul>
		<li>Mail Services</li>
		<ul>
			<li>Exchange</li>
			<li>MailEnable</li>
			<li>Postfix</li>
			<li>Sendmail</li>
		</ul>
		<li>File Sharing Services</li>
		<ul>
			<li>FTP (vsFTPd, Filezilla)</li>
			<li>SMB (Samba, Windows SMB)</li>
		</ul>
		<li>CMS Services</li>
		<ul>
			<li>WordPress</li>
			<li>Joomla</li>
		</ul>

		<ul>
			<li>OpenVPN</li>
		</ul>
		<li>Identity Management Services</li>
		<ul>
			<li>Active Directory Domain Services</li>
		</ul>
	</ol>

	<h4>Method 2 - Operating System Familiarity</h4>
	<p>There are three main operating system that CyberPatriot uses
	in their competitions. We know them as Windows, Windows Server,	
	and Ubuntu. We do so now, but Hypernova encourages a fundamental
	understanding of the operating that you may be working on. This 
	would include able to modify the Registery in Windows and poisoning
	a package to keep reinstalling itself to lock apt from doing 
	anything. Immersing yourself with the operating system spans
	many different aspects. A common way is to use the operating
	system on a computer that you often use. Also using community
	built practice images will be extremely beneficial.</p>

	<p>Gathering a good source of infomation on your operating
	system. This would not only be the settings of your operating
	system but to fully control your operating system.</p>

	<p>Fortunately Hypernova has provided a list of things that 
	we should look into if you want a better understanding of 
	the operating systems that we compete with.</p>

	<ul>
		<li>Linux:</li>
		<ul>
			<li>User and Password Management: /etc/passwd, /etc/group, /etc/shadow</li>
			<li>Pluggable Authentication Modules (PAM)</li>
			<li>Tunable Kernel Parameters (Sysctl)</li>
			<li>Package Managers (APT/DNF)</li>
			<li>CRON</li>
			<li>Permissions</li>
			<li>Systemd</li>
			<li>Sudo</li>
			<li>Polkit</li>
		</ul>

		<li>Windows:</li>
		<ul>
			<li>Windows User Management</li>
			<li>Local Security Policy</li>
			<li>Group Policy</li>
			<li>Registry Editor</li>
			<li>Task Scheduler</li>
			<li>Windows Defender</li>
			<li>Permissions</li>
			<li>Service Manager</li>
		</ul>
	</ul>
	
	<h2 id="RtC">Section 2 - Respecting the Challenge</h2>
	<p>Hypernova highlights that many people tend to take shortcuts
	when preparing and competiting. There is a sort of right way to 
	do things, such as:</p>
	
	<ol>
		<li>Creating proper configurations for servers and
		ensuring the changes apply to the certain service you
		are configuring.</li>
		<li>Testing before, don't go into the competition
		testing out things for the first time.</li>
		<li>Dev testing your programs for errors.</li>
	</ol>

	<h2 id="BM">Section 3 - Baselining and Meld</h2>
	<p>Baselining represents comparing clean or secured configurations
	and environments to the ones in the challenge image. Hypernova gives 
	an example when they went on a linux image, they would spend the 
	first hour comparing permission values and changes that have appeared
	in the system. Which is pretty genius since it can highlight a whole 
	bunch of issues that potentially could be solved.</p>
	
	<p>The tool used to compare files and configurations is something
	called <a href="http://meldmerge.org/">Meld</a> which Hypernova,
	says that it is a visually based diffing and merging tool for 
	files and directories that works in Linux and Windows.</p>

	<p>It can be used in Windows but Hypernova outlines that
	it is more difficult to set a base line. This could be because it's
	more difficult to get a list of every single directory, or purely
	because Linux and Windows work differently.</p>

	<h2 id="Automation">Section 4 - Automation (Consistency vs. Speed)</h2>
	<p>Script apparently are extremely imporant. Hypernova has made it
	clear that scripts could be the piece that we are missing. Though they
	give a tip for new competitors, and it's to build for consistency rather
	than speed. The problems with the speed method is:</p>

	<ul>
		<li>Spending too much too optimizing. Lose the purpose of the
		script. Build a quality script.</li>
		<li>Only building the script, not having any other plan.</li>
	</ul>
	
	<p>Hypernova recommeneds these methods on scripting:</p>
	
	<ul>
		<li>Focus on the purpose of the script.</li>
		<li>Keep up with developement.</li>
		<li>Adapt your plan with the results and incorperate your script</li>

	</ul>

	<h2 id="TG">Section 5 - Testing and Gameplans</h2>
	<p>It's important to keep testing gameplans, and scripts. Hypernova, states
	that it is not rare to see a teams script breaking. Putting through a lot
	of testing can decide between your script working and breaking on competition
	day. Hypernova puts it simply, play smart.</p>

	<p>A plan that Hypernova has for Linux is the following: (Also provided in this <a href="linuxgameplan.txt" download="linuxgameplan.txt">txt</a> document)</p>
	<ol>
		<li>README</li>
		<li>Forensic Questions</li>
		<li>Initialize scripts and fix anything preventing script from running</li>
		<li>Baselining</li>
		<li>Users & Groups</li>
		<li>Backdoor & Malware Hunting</li>
		<li>Updates</li>
		<li>Reboot to apply kernel updates</li>
		<li>Package and service management</li>
		<li>System hardening (PAM, Sysctl, Sudoers, Polkit, Bootloader, etc.)</li>
		<li>Critical Service security</li>
		<li>File and directory permissions</li>
		<li>Point Scrounging</li>
	</ol>

	<h2 id="team-composition">Section 6 - Team Composition</h2>
	<p>One of the best advice that Hypernova provides is the team setup
	advice that he gives. Hypernova recalls certain moments when teams
	crumbled under the pressure due to how their team is setup.</p>

	<p>Hypernova then explains a six person team, which currently isn't possible.
	Not just because for our Cybertitan team cannot fit six members but according
	to the rules we can only have five members on a team competing at the same time.
	They explain how it is beneficial to have a sixth member due to how many challenges
	lie in the competition but unfortunately we cannot compete with six members.</p>

	<p>Hypernova still has a great team composition template that we should take into account</p>

	<ul>
		<li>Windows Competitors (2 Members)</li>
		<ul>
			<li>First three rounds have two windows images, rather than one linux.</li>
			<li>Windows can be more tricky, difficult to get automation.</li>
			<li>Windows challenges tend to be more problematic.</li>
		</ul>
		<li>Linux Competitor (1 Member)</li>
		<ul>
			<li>Linux only has one image in the first three rounds.</li>
			<li>Linux is more managable in than Windows. Much more automation potential.</li>
		</ul>
		<li>Linux/Extra Competitor (1 Member)</li>
		<ul>
			<li>The role of this competitor is to provide assistance to the primary linux
			competitor.</li>
			<li>Also, pursuing any extra points are or become available.</li>
		</ul>
		<li>Dedicated Cisco Competitor (1 Member)</li>
		<ul>
			<li>This competitor is going to be focused on Cisco Packet Tracer and gathering
			all the points that come through that route.</li>
		</ul>
		<li>'Jack of All Trades' Competitor (NOT ALLLOWED DUE TO LIMIT OF 5 MEMEBERS 1 Member (Subsitute))</li>
		<ul>
			<li>Helps with everyother competitor to make the process smooth and simple.</li>
		</ul>

	</ul>

	<h2 id="TeamC">Section 7 - Team Cohension</h2>
	<p>Establishing good teamwork is all apart of making up a good team. Having
	the strength and confidence in your teammates can make sure that communication
	can stay open and is integral espcially for these competitions. Building a strong 
	connection with your team members is quite valuable.</p>

	<p>Hypernova also lays down a couple of helpful tips for teams in general: (Not Anything We Haven't Seen)</p>

	<h4>Regular Team Meetings</h4>
	<p>We already do regular meetings and by the next year (24-25) season coming around,
	we are stepping things up to a whole new level. A firm schedule will be planned,
	and we will have required meeting times and some optional. But it's to make
	sure each one of us knows exactly what we need to do.</p>

	<h4>Consistently doing Tasks</h4>
	<p>This is certainly an area that we haven't been too invested in. But this can
	help keep people's intrest. Projects spanning from each individual person to
	create something to help the team. Hypernova gives the idea of a virtual
	whiteboard to use, which sounds pretty neat.</p>

	<h4>Sharing Resources</h4>
	<p>This project now is my sharing which I plan on continuing and building for everyone.
	Teams should develop stratagies and then share them because your teammate may just
	have that answer you have been looking for.</p>

	<h2 id="0-H">Section 8 - Hypernova's Zero to Hero Plan</h2>
	<p>As a note this plan will change and adapt to what we do here at Cybertitan, but
	notes will be taken and implemented to gain the best experience we can have.</p>

	<p>Hypernova's Zero to Hero Plan consists of many different parts, but hightlights
	all of the resources that we need to take all of our teams to the Nationals.</p>	

	<ol>
		<li>Laying the Groundwork</li>
		<ol>
			<li>Starting as early as possible. A quick way to get ahead of 
				everyone else.</li>
			<li>Build a well-balanced team. This should be a team that
			works well with each other.</li>
			<li>Setup a proper schedule and standards for the team.</li>
			<li>Keep communication lines open. Make sure everyone knows what
			is happening at all times</li>
		</ol>
		<li>Experience the Challenge</li>
		<ol>
			<li>The AFA release different practice images through the year,
			but for the most part they aren't going to provide an advaned
			look at what to prepare for. Hypernova has provided some community
			built practice images.</li>
			<ul>

			especially going into a cybersecurity competition. There are 
			some rebust OS hardening scripts, not created but provided by
			Hypernova.</li>

		<ol>
			<li>Always being prepared with a plan for each competition is crucial.
			Setting up the right plan is important too. Putting good information
			rather than info just for the info.</li>
		</ol>
		<li>Practice and More Practice</li>
		<ol>
			<li>Hypernova suggst practicing frequently to make sure that any 
			scripts work, and to make sure to iron out any wrinkles. Hypernova
			ranks these images as 'medium' difficulty.</li>

			</ul>
			<li>A note that I read was Hypernova strongly suggests doing all of this 
			before Round 1.</li>
		</ol>
		<li>Compete (Sounds simple??)</li>
		<ol>
			<li>The goal to compete is set pretty high, trying to get into
			the Nationals. From Hypernova's experience they state you can
			miss only a few (being 2 vulnerabilities per round across all
			images). Which is quite a standard but they also state that
			after the Rounds 1 & 2 being in the Top 30 to 40 is a good
			place to be for qualifying for Nationals.</li>
		</ol>
		<li>Improve and Continue Preparation</li>
		<ol>
			<li>The first competition is quite simple, and this is 
			exactly what is setup but gives the teams a chance to 
			regroup and discuss. Hypernova suggests spending time with the
			team and ironing everything else that happened through Round 1.</li>
		</ol>
		<li>Compete (Round 2 this time...)</li>
		<ol>
			<li>Round 2 is known to be amped up, humbling
                    anyone who thought that they were going to
                    do well. Hypernova sets a standard of only
                    missing 4-5 vulnerabilities across all images.
                    To score high on Cisco, and reach the top
                    25 teams. </li>
			<li>It's about information gathering you need 
                    to gather as much information as possible.
                    The other teams with more experience know what
                    they need to do, we need to make up for 
                    experience with research and dedication.</li>
		</ol>
		<li>Repeating Step 9</li>
		<ol>
			<li>Hypernova advises that complex services and 
                    scenarios are increasing and finding those 
                    important points are compicated and is to
                    be expected.</li>
			<li>Preparing for the spike in difficulty. This
                    is preparation for the difficult level which is 
                    said to challenge anyone's gameplan and checklist.
                    Hypernova says the time between these competitions,
                    is where teams begin to break since coming off two
                    rapid competitions to a month and half break.</li>
			<ol>
				<li>Advice given by Hypernova during this time.
                        Planning, teamwork and attention to detail is crucial
                        for this stage since you can do review and correct errors
                        from previous rounds. Research is again needed once more to
                        gain back an edge to what may come up. Scripts should be 
                        modified for the next round.</li>
			</ol>
			<li>Practicing with practice images is also a method to
                    increase your preparation. These images are more designed
                    for the State Round (Round 3).</li>

                	</ol>
		</ol>
       			 <li>Compete (Round 3 this time!)</li>
        		<ol>
            			<li>Hypernova has another standard for the State Round.
                We should only be missing 8 vulnerabilities at max
                to set yourself up to get into the top 12-15 teams in 
                the round.
            			</li>
        		</ol>
       			<li>Prepare Once Again</li>
       	 		<ol>
           		 	<li>This is again more preparation, to keep onto those top
                teams. Nationals should be on their way so we are going
                preparing much more. Everything is basically at stake. 
                If you miss a vulnerability that may be the one thing 
                keeping you away from the Nationals.
            			</li>
            			<li>Hypernova also gives even more practice images:
