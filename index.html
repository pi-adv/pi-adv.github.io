	<h4 style="text-align: center;">About Me</h4>
	<p>I am a team captain at a Cybertitan program in Canada. I haven't qualified more Nationals and I want to finally step foot into the ring I have done minimal coding up until now where scripting and writing html and css has become a big 
		part of what I do. On my team I compete with four others and I'm the Cisco person for our team! Hope you find this site useful! :>
