	<h1>Ubuntu Basics</h1>
	<p>Ubuntu can be quite scary to many people since of how much freedom that you can have
		and how much customizability that you have. Which is understandable but it's much
		easier than you think. Once you pick up a few key terminal commands, you can do 
		pretty much as much you can do on Windows just on your keyboard.
	</p>
	<p>Ubuntu is a distroduction from the linux family of operating system flavours. There are 
		many more including Debian and Fedora that you might come accross in competition. 
		These other distructions revolve around the same concept, which is great rather than
		learning distrobutions again, and again.
	</p>
	<h4>Terminal</h4>
	<p>Like I said before the one item in Ubuntu that you are going to be interacting with is
		the terminal. The terminal has a specific set of commands that you can use. For example
		to change a directory (moving into a different folder on the computer), you use the cd
		command which stands for C hange D irectory. A couple other common commands is using
		the apt command. APT is a package manager which you can use to install, remove and update 
		packages from.
	</p>
	<p>Their are plenty of other commands and once you install a package some will add even more
		commands that you can use in the terminal. Another important note about using the terminal
		is understanding the hierarchy of the system. 
	</p>
	<ol>
		<li>First is the root user. This user is supposed to be protected by a password and change 
			EVERYTHING about the computer. Nothing is off limits and should be well protected.
		</li>
		<li>Second is the administrator user. This user has the ability to call the sudo command before
			the initial command is called. This lets whatever after sudo to be run as if it is the root
			user. However this has limitations.
		</li>
		<li>Last is the standard user. This user you will be not interacting with much, however they
			do not have the same privilages as the admin user and can only use non-root commands in 
			the terminal. (However there is a sudoers file but that will be mentioned later)
		</li>
	</ol>
	<p>With this information, I'll recap. Working with Ubuntu, you will have to work with the terminal.
		You can do anything in the terminal, and there are certain commands to do certain things. There 
		is a hierarchy that permits certain users to do their certain things.
	</p>
	<h4>User Interface</h4>
	<p>Although Ubuntu can be run mainly from the terminal, there is a desktop interface that you can use
		to navigate the entire system. Mostly you can rely on the UI for setting up Users, changing the internet,
		and navigating the file system with visable icons. For some cases the desktop interface makes things
		a lot easier to do. However not everything can be done without running into the terminal. The 
		browser that you will run to load the Cyberpatriot websites will rely on the desktop interface. You 
		will need to juggle them both and make sure you are able to navigate through both of these.
