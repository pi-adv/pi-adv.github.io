    <p id="titlep">PAM is security settings that protects everything from accounts, authorization and passwords. These files are going
        to be located in the /etc/pam.d directory that will have four crucial files that you are going to do changes. (for the most part).
    </p>
    <p>The four files are:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>common-auth</li>
        <li>common-account</li>
        <li>common-password</li>
        <li>common-session</li>
    </ol>
    <p>For example purposes we are going to take a look at the common-password file. Also for credit I am following the video from 
        <a href="https://youtu.be/eHGzzCtJg0A?si=WLmkoJaH5D6U5Gvk">Linux, Visually.</a> </p>
    <p>PAM files are used for most backbone settings for passwords and account creation. These will run in the background or run with
        a command that involve anything to do with passwords. In the directory you will find some files that are exactly like commands. 
        Take the passwd file. passwd is a command and is used to change your password when you run it. Inside of the file is the following:
    </p>
    <code>
        #
        # The PAM configuration file for the Shadow 'passwd' service 
        #

        @include common-password
    </code>
    <p>The @include calls a certain file that proceeds after the @include is called. Since the common-password file is called, everything in 
        common-password file will be insert and used in the passwd file and when you call the passwd command. Since this happens when you open 
        up any other file that connects itself with a command or service, one or multiple PAM files could be included to use its contents. How 
        PAMs files are configured so that they deploy a certain standard accross the whole system. 
    </p>
    <p>There are four different sections of a line in a PAM file. Taking the common-password file (here is a <a href="common-password.txt" donwload="common-password">copy</a> in txt form.)</p>
    <ol>
        <p>Of course this will be different for the common-auth/account/session. Some modules will apply differently.</p>
        <li>First section/column ex: |password|</li>
        <p>This first column will tell you what the following sections will apply to. password is for password types, account is for account types, etc.</p>
        <li>Second section/column ex: |requisite|</li>
        <p>This second column tells you the level of this line is interpreted. There are many different levels that start as being required to even run, 
            or that can be skipped even if it fails. The hierarchy works a like regular and it's pretty simple to follow. 
        </p>
    </ol>
