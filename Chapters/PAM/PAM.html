    <p id="titlep">PAM is a tool that manages a lot of security modules that determines if a user is who they are.</p>

    <p>Generally PAM is what is figuring out who is who on your computer. When anyone logs in or changes their password 
        PAM handles everything so it's a smooth easy process.
    </p>
    <p>There are application specific files that are controlled by PAM. Usually you will find that the common- files are 
        going to be referenced in every specific file. These common- files include:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>common-auth</li>
        <li>common-account</li>
        <li>common-password</li>
        <li>common-session</li>
    </ul>
