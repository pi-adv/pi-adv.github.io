    <h1>PAM</h1>
    <p>PAM is a tool that manages a lot of security modules that determines if a user is who they are.</p>

    <p>Generally PAM is what is figuring out who is who on your computer. When anyone logs in or changes their password 
        PAM handles everything so it's a smooth easy process.
    </p>
    <p>There are application specific files that are controlled by PAM. Usually you will find that the common- files are 
        going to be referenced in every specific file. These common- files include:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>common-auth</li>
        <li>common-account</li>
        <li>common-password</li>
        <li>common-session</li>
    </ul>

    <p>In brief terms these are the management team of your system. These files have certain functions that apply to critical areas of your computer.
        Fortunately they are all located in the pam.d directory which makes it easy to modify them. PAM as a whole is about authenticating the user, making sure that 
        you are who you say you are. 
    </p>
    <p>PAM works by using libraries to offer module configurable support for anything on the system. This means that you can set your management team to be as 
        strict as you want on your system. 
    </p>

    <h4>common-password file</h4>
    <p>Opening up the common-password file you will find all the intructions that are initiated when you are doing anything revolving a password. Looking at the file,
        there is quite a few comments, which describe what is going on in the file. If you are planning on writing to the file, make sure to include your own comments
        to keep track what you implemented. You have multiple modules written in the file on each line and are activated one by one or sequential order.
    </p>
    <p>There are four field in one line in a PAM file.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>First Field (ex: password)</li>
        <p>This field tells you what the line is modifying or associated with. In this file everything will have the password in the first field.</p>
        <li>Second Field (ex: requisite)</li>
        <p>This field tells you the behavior of the line. This field has many different items which will be in more detail below.</p>
        <li>Third Field (ex: pam_pwquality)</li>
        <p>This field is the action that the line will take. These are presumably scripts that will run for one reason or another. More of them are listed below.</p>
        <li>Fourth Field (ex: retry=3)</li>
        <p>This field will contain all of the arguements that is needed for the line and field three. There are many different arguements that you can use that may 
            apply to your script.</p>
    </ul>

    <p>EXAMPLE of the first line of the common-password file.</p>
    <p>password     requisite      pam_pwquality.so        retry=3</p>
    <p>A side note; the pwquality.so module deals with setting a proper password. Third line deals with the actions of the line.</p>

    <table style="width: 80%;">
        <tr>
            <td style="text-align: center;">Sample PAM stack (order of operations)</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>

            <td>GOOD</td>
        </tr>
    </table>

    <p>Field Two has four examples here that have some more detail regarding the stack.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>REQUIRED</li>
        <p>If fails, goes through the stack but FAILS at the end.</p>
        <li>REQUISITE</li>
        <p>If fails, stops the stack and FAILS.</p>
        <li>OPTIONAL</li>
        <p>If fails, doesn't impact the success or failure rate of the stack.</p>
        <li>SUFFICIENT</li>
        <p>Checks if anything else has failed, if so, it fails but doesn't impact the stack.</p>
    </p>

    <h4>Programs</h4>
    <p>Certain programs with any sort of account based or password authentication feature will appear in the pam.d directory when installed.
        Opening these up will show you how that certain application authenticates users. Typically it will use the include function to bring the 
        contents of the common- files to that file. SSH for example, once installed includes many common- files but also has its own code special
        to the security of the application.
    </p>
    <p>If you ever looked in the pam.d directory you should have found the passwd file, which is a command that can be run to change the password of your 
        account or another one's (with root privileges). Opening that file, it's quite small and include the common-password file. If you ever build an 
        application of a command script to be used in linux, make sure to include the PAM files, they are extremely useful and as easy as using the 
        include function to bring security to what you are building.
    </p>
    <p>A final word would be to make sure that you are careful when it comes down to changing a common- file. Since mostly everything relies on it, one 
        small change could lock you out of the computer. So, before using the information and tossing it into competition make sure that your methods work 
        before any changes are made.
