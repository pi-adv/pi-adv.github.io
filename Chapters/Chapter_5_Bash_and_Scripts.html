	<p id="titlep">This page is all about developing a good connect with bash, which is used to create scripts to automate processes.
		The use cases are endless with scripts where you could automate users to even more complex scripts for figuring out hashes.
		Though it's not only bash that you can create scripts. Bash is for Linux, and powershell is for Windows. Creating powershell 
		programs/scripts can reap the same benefits on Windows as Linux.

	<h4>Resources</h4>
	<p>Of course there are a couple of resources that I am using to aid my ability to learn how to script. Since there are many ways you can do this I have included a few different 
		ones.
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Here is a free ebook that goes over scripting <a href="https://github.com/bobbyiliev/introduction-to-bash-scripting?tab=readme-ov-file#-introduction-to-bash-scripting">(bash scripting)</a></li>
		<li>Here is an official resource from Microsoft for <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/script-with-powershell/">Powershell Scripting</a></li>
	</ul>
	<p>There are also many other resources including some from paid and free resources. Codecademy has a couple of courses on bash scripting, but there are many free ones that 
		you shouldn't need to pay for any sort of resource.
