	<h1>Working with Packet Tracer</h1>
	<p>Packet Tracer is neat. Even though many people hate it or think that it's too complicated, it's fun and cool to work with.
		I can admit the only thing that takes time to be able to learn how to use Packet Tracer, but also to master what you are 
		using. Fortunately, there are many different resources that you can be taken through so that you can learn. There are three 
		courses that you should VERY MUCH CONSIDER taking:
	</p>

	</ol>
	<p>There are plenty more of resources online but these are provided by Cyberpatriot. This is fantastic since they are FREE and 
		take a combined 8 hours, if you follow the course. I found they also provide packet tracer training which comes through the 
		.pka files that are provided. Which I'll link to download.

	<p>Giving some more information about Cisco Packet Tracer, I will be following the courses in the order above. Of course giving some 
		other experiences with Cisco that could help your learning process.
	</p>
	<h4>Getting Started -- Packet Tracer</h4>
	<p>This is a very simple introduction into Packet Tracer, fortunately you can also download cisco packet tracer through the skillsforall 
		program that Cisco has in place. You will need Packet Tracer to do these certain things, there is no online interface. You will need 
		a Windows or Linux computer to run it.
	</p>
	<p>In Packet Tracer there is two different interfaces, the logical and physical side. The logical side is the place where will want to 
		configure all of your devices, and is the place where you place your devices and network devices that you need for the environment. 
		I find that this side is useful to connect devices as well. The physical side of the environment is where you would want to setup a 
		scenario. It is also a place where you can setup a interface that uses servers and connections so instead of a white background,
		you can make it more 'real-life'.
	</p>
	<p>Using the logical interface, in the bottom left, you will have loads of devices that you can choose from. Including a connection 
		section to connect all of those devices that you put onto the environment. Typically you will need a end device, router or switch,
		a ISP, then loads of connectors and connections to make sure everything is connected, that needs to be. 
	</p>
	<p>Using the physical interface works like the logical side but are typically used to set up locations and the overall setup of 
		a server room would like or an office to bring it more life. When entering a competition or tutored lesson you with have the 
		physical side to give you more information about how the scenario looks like. 
	</p>
	<h4>Creating a Simple Network</h4>
	<p>For the first activity use the 2.1.1 lab to follow along. Our main objectives here is to connect a laptop, PC to the internet Using
		the cable modem. When you open the lab in packet tracer, you will be presented with the objectives on the left, and the environment 
		on the right. You already have a couple things set up. A wireless router, which you will use to connect the PC and Laptop first. And 
		then you have the internet, which is a cloud. Then the server hosted on the internet. 
	</p>
	<ol>
		<li>First lets setup the devices.</li>
		<p>In the bottom left corner, go End Devices => PC, and drag or click on the PC icon. Drag or click to the screen to place the PC. Go back 
		into the same place and click or drag the Laptop to the screen. </p>
		<li>Second, lets change some names.</li>
		<p>Changing the names can help when you have a lot of devices on the screen. To do this, go to (Click a device on the screen) => (In the pop-up window)
			click on config => Change the display name. Every device has this method of changing their names. Do step 1 & 2 for the cable modem. It's
			located in the Network Devices => WAN emulation => Cable Modem.</p>
		<li>Third, connect the devices.</li>
		<p>You need to make sure that all of your devices are connected properly. Some devices only use certain connections to hook up to certain
			ports. Taking the PC, go to Connections => Copper Straight-Through Wire. (third is the list of connections). Then hover over the 
			PC and click. You want to hook up to FastEthernet0. Move your mouse to the wireless router and click. Select the Ethernet 1 port.
			You should see the wire obtain two different markers on it. These are to show you the connection between the two devices. Both 
			sides will show the status of the connection on either side respectfully. </p>
		<p>A different method is applied for the Laptop. Click on Laptop and open the 'Physical' section. Turn off the power with the power 
			button located on the left of the image of the laptop. Click and drag the ethernet port (network card) to the menu on the left. With the 
			black empty space, you want to click and drag the WPC300N part to the same place the network card came from. Turn on the power. Now that
			we can connect wirelessly, navigate to the 'Desktop' section, and click on 'PC Wireless'. In this application open the 'Connect' section 
			and click 'Refresh'. A new network called HomeNetwork should appear. Click on it and press 'Connect'. When you exit the laptop, you 
			should now see that the laptop has black bars connecting it to the router. The laptop is connected via wireless.  </p>
		<p>The router is connected to the cable modem using a copper straight through wire. Go to Connections => Copper Straight-Through Wire.
			click on the router and use the 'Internet' port. Click on the modem and use 'Port 1'.</p>
		<p>The final last device to connect is the cable modem. The modem requires another cable called the Coaxial cable. It's the same method to 
			connect the device. Go to Connections => Coaxial Wire. Click on the modem and use 'Port 0' then click on the 
			Internet Cloud and use 'Coaxial 7'.</p>
		<p>If you want to make sure everything is working, you should only see green triangles on the wires.</p>
		<li>Fourth is to configure the PC.</li>
		<p>You can configure everything about the devices that you are putting in the environment, especially the IP addresses. Click the PC and 
			open the 'Desktop' section. Open the 'IP Configuration' app. From here everything can be customized to a tee. Though for this example you
			are going to go under the IP Configuration and change it from 'Static' to 'DHCP'. Essentially the different is that static stays the same 
			and is used if you are manually setting all of the values. DHCP lets the router handle the IP addressing and you don't decide what IP 
			address is assigned and it fills the rest of the fields. Close the app and load the 'Command Prompt'. In the command prompt you want to 
			test to see if you are connected and can get a report back from the Cisco.srv server in the environment. All you need to do is type: 
			<code>ping cisco.srv</code>. It should take a couple or more seconds for you to get a reply but you should recieve reports back from the 
			Cisco.srv server.
		</p>
		<li>Lastly is to configure the Laptop.</li>
		<p>The laptop is pretty easy to deal with. Since you have already connected it to the internet we need to check to see if it can connect to 
			the server. Click on Laptop => go to 'Desktop' section => open the web browser app. Once opened type <code>cisco.srv</code> in the url bar.
			If you are correctly loaded than you should be taken to a site hosted on the cisco.srv server!
		</p>
	</ol>
	<p>Surprisingly that is really all there is to it. Connect devices and check the connectivity. There are more advanced things you can do, but 
		if you are starting out this is good place to be. Next would be continuing the course and completing all three of the courses to set you up
		for the competitions. More courses and resources will be found to help you understand and gain points for your team.
