	<h1>Working with Packet Tracer</h1>
	<p>Packet Tracer is neat. Even though many people hate it or think that it's too complicated, it's fun and cool to work with.
		I can admit the only thing that takes time to be able to learn how to use Packet Tracer, but also to master what you are 
		using. Fortunately, there are many different resources that you can be taken through so that you can learn. There are three 
		courses that you should VERY MUCH CONSIDER taking:

	</ol>
	<p>There are plenty more of resources online but these are provided by Cyberpatriot. This is fantastic since they are FREE and 
		take a combined 8 hours, if you follow the course. I found they also provide packet tracer training which comes through the 
		.pka files that are provided. Which I'll link to download.

	<p>Giving some more information about Cisco Packet Tracer, I will be following the courses in the order above. Of course giving some 
		other experiences with Cisco that could help your learning process.
	</p>
	<h4>Getting Started -- Packet Tracer</h4>
	<p>This is a very simple introduction into Packet Tracer, fortunately you can also download cisco packet tracer through the skillsforall 
		program that Cisco has in place. You will need Packet Tracer to do these certain things, there is no online interface. You will need 
		a Windows or Linux computer to run it.
	</p>
	<p>In Packet Tracer there is two different interfaces, the logical and physical side. The logical side is the place where will want to 
		configure all of your devices, and is the place where you place your devices and network devices that you need for the environment. 
		I find that this side is useful to connect devices as well. The physical side of the environment is where you would want to setup a 
		scenario. It is also a place where you can setup a interface that uses servers and connections so instead of a white background,
		you can make it more 'real-life'.
	</p>
	<p>Using the logical interface, in the bottom left, you will have loads of devices that you can choose from. Including a connection 
		section to connect all of those devices that you put onto the environment. Typically you will need a end device, router or switch,
		a ISP, then loads of connectors and connections to make sure everything is connected, that needs to be.
