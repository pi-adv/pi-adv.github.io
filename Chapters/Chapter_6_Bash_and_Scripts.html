	<p id="titlep">This page is all about developing a good connect with bash, which is used to create scripts to automate processes.
		The use cases are endless with scripts where you could automate users to even more complex scripts for figuring out hashes.
		Though it's not only bash that you can create scripts. Bash is for Linux, and powershell is for Windows. Creating powershell 
		programs/scripts can reap the same benefits on Windows as Linux.
