	<p>Windows is the operating system that most people are going to start on. The fact that many peoples first experience with a computer
		has been on Windows, it only makes sense to start out. I find though that since you have started out before the idea of Cybersecurity
		you may have developed some bad habits using the operating system. For the most part these bad habits are pretty simple, keeping 
		very simple passwords, keeping open 16 different applications open, nothing that cannot be worked out. 
	</p>
	<p>The main thing that you need to pay attention to when it comes to Windows machines, is that Windows has a nice outer shell. The UI is 
		typically easy to use and installing anything on a Windows computer is quite simple. The hard part is when you have to lift that hood 
		and see all of inner workings of Windows. I would argue that Windows can be as difficult as Ubuntu, since Ubuntu does certain things 
		better and Windows does certain things worse. It all depends on how you move around the system and learn how to work the machine that is 
		Windows.
	</p>
	<h4>Basic Setup</h4>
	<p>The concept of using the terminal as the main source of doing things in Ubuntu is the complete opposite concept that it for Windows. Mostly 
		you will be fooling around a user interface that will have applications for everything that you need to do. There are times where you will 
		have to pull out powershell or cmd, but for the majority, you are safe to use the UI.
	</p>
	<p>So lets make a list of some basics things to do, logged on to a competition image:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>README, Forensic Questions</li>
		<li>Users</li>
		<li>Firewall</li>
		<li>Groups</li>
		<li>Local Security Policy</li>
		<li>Basic File Explorer Info</li>
	</ul>
	<h4>README, Forensic Questions</h4>
	<p>The main part of first looking at a machine that you are competiting on, is to look at the README file and making notes of anything that 
		you should and shouldn't do with the machine. Near the bottom is the large section of allowed users on the system which is going to be 
		the main part of your notes. Making sure that you note users, services and any other specifc intruction unique to your system. These could 
		be important to a wide range of things, including the users, forensic questions or software that needs to stay on the machine. Fortunately
		you don't need to take notes too seriously rereading and keeping the README on screen to use as a reference is the most recommended way to 
		analyze the README.
	</p>
	<p>Forensic Questions are questions located on the desktop of your machine. On Windows you are typically going to have the most questions than 
		Ubuntu and Server, but again depending on the competition. Opening the forensic questions in notepad will show an example of how to enter 
		your answer to get the points linked with the Forensic Questions. The process is setup quite well. The hard part comes when you have to 
		analyze and find the answer to the question. These could be a wide range of questions, which I find most common on Windows, is finding either 
		a file on the disk, or a hash for a picture on the desktop. These of course can be solved by searching up certain things online but the 
		importance of these questions cannot be stressed enough. Each question is worth around 8-10 points each (depending on the round). This is 
		extremely important to answer correctly since those points are leaps and bounds espically when it comes to later rounds. Make sure you are 
		on top of everything that you can do on Windows. When competition comes we can only guess what they will through at us.
	</p>
	<h4>Users</h4>
	<p>Users are pretty much the same that you would do with Ubuntu. With the users, you will need to be able to add, remove and change the users 
		on your machine. There is two different ways to do this. Through the control panel or Windows Settings. I like using the control panel so 
		the steps that follow will reflect that.
	</p>
	<ol>
		<li>Open up the control panel.</li>
		<li>Click 'User Accounts'</li>
		<li>Click 'Remove User Accounts'.</li>
		<li>Delete, add, or change passwords, account types by clicking on a user account that you wish to change.</li>
	</ol>
	<p>This is where you should do all of your user changes. If you mix things up, you might not get everything and miss someone. Make sure before 
		you finish with the users that you double check the README that you did not miss anything.</p>
	<h4>Firewall</h4>
	<p>The firewall is extremely important to activate as well, having the same theme as everything you should do on this page as its good points to 
		get started. The firewall can only be managed through the control panel and the rules where you can make outbound and inbound rules is in an
		advanced firewall application that does not turn on the firewall only deals with the rules of the firewall. You don't need to configure anything 
		on the firewall settings other than turning it on, unless the README specifies otherwise.
	</p>
	<ol>
		<li>Open up the control panel.</li>
		<li>Click on 'System and Security'</li>
		<li>Click on 'Windows Defender Firewall'</li>
		<li>On the left click on 'Turn Windows Defender Firewall on or off'</li>
		<li>In the menu turn on the firewall.</li>
	</ol>
	<p>That's all, and it's pretty simple and quick to do. Be aware that in the section when you turn on the firewall, you can block connections. You do 
		not want to turn this on. I have had plenty of experiences where you are using a OpenSSH service and block any connections which effectively shuts 
		down any methods of accessing that service. You lose points and again, unless specified in the README, don't block any connection. If you need to 
		set up rules, go back to the main firewall settings and click 'Advanced settings'. Settings up the firewall on Windows is a lot easier than Ubuntu 
		the GUI is a little more user friendly.
	</p>
	<h4>Groups</h4>
	<p>Groups are incredibly important to make sure that you know how to configure them. On the image it will presumably asking you something about the groups 
		found on this machine. You will need to go to a certain app to get that information. Fortunately it is sort out quite nicely but it can get confusing.
		In the app you can modify, add and remove groups as well as changing their permissions to what they are allowed to do on the computer.
