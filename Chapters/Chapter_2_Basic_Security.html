	<p>Basic security is the topic of securing the machines the simplest ways.
		These areas aren't difficult things to do but the basic things that you
		should consider doing the easiest challenges first, then doing the 
		harder challenges. These points are pretty easy to get and these could
		be scripted.
	</p>    
	<p>You need to be familiar with a few things before you start and gather
		the first few security challenges.
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Having read the README</li>
		<li>Notes, perferably anything with the image</li>
		<li>Scripts for the certain operating system you are on</li>
	</ul>
	<h4 id="U&G">SECTION 1.1 -- Users & Groups</h4>
	<p>The first stop that you should go to is the Users and Groups.</p>
	<p>Users and Groups are going to find settings to set the accounts.
		You want to make note of the users, and their account type to be able 
		to modify every user that needs to be changed.
	</p>
	<p>Depending on your operating system that you are on, groups will be 
		managed a different way. On windows, groups will be in an application
		called Local Users and Groups, and on Ubuntu it will be easier going 
		through the terminal.
	</p>
	<p>Other than changing the account type and changing passwords, the only
		other form of changes would be adding users, and putting them in 
		specific groups themselves. Otherwise, you may come across users
		when dealing with the Forensic Questions.
	</p>
	<h4 id="FQ">Forensic Questions</h4>
	<p>Forensic Questions are challenges placed on the desktop that involve you
		finding something on the computer, and either changing or finding something
		specific about that information.
	</p>
	<p>There are typically 2-3 Forensic Questions on each image. Of course, these
		will get more difficult as the competitions go by. Making sure that you
		are up-to-date with everything you need to navigate your operating system,
		is key to not fall behind and get too stumped when reading a Forensic
		Question.
	</p>
	<p>The format is pretty simple since they give an example of how to complete
		a Forensic Question in each text document that contains a Forensic Question.
	</p>
	<ol>
		<li>Example in the start of the Forensic Question txt document.</li>
		<li>The actual question is asked after the example is finished.</li>
		<li>The answer area will be below that and by removing everything after 
			the answer text, you put your answer to the question.
		</li>
		<li>Save the text file before closing.</li>
	</ol>
	<h4 id="F">Firewalls</h4>
	<p>There are many ways to secure your machine and one of those ways is securing
		the network. Firewalls are quite important and a pretty quick to set up. 
		A firewall is protection from any sort of connection coming into and out to
		the internet and to your computer. You can usually customize these to 
		be more strict or loose with the restrictions but for competition you 
		need to set these firewalls to the default settings.
	</p>
	<p>Taking Ubuntu for example, it's quick simple to setup. First is to install the 
		GUI or use the terminal configuration to turn on the firewall. Using the GUI,
		open the application and click the switch to turn the firewall on (called the ufw
		or gufw for the GUI version). That's the entire process that's all you need to do.
	</p>
	<p>On all machines you can also add, change and remove rules. Which will modify what
		can access your machine. Make sure that you know what port, or address that you
		are adding or removing since if a service relies to go through the firewall to 
		function, you want to leave that port alone.
	</p>
	<h4 id="LSP">Local Security Policy</h4>
	<p>The Local Security Policy or LSP, has many, many different settings that you
		need to configure to gain and secure the machine that you are using. !NOTE! The 
		LSP is only avaliable on Windows and Server, you have to use a different piece
		of software called PAM.
	</p>
	<p>In the LSP there is quite a few settings, which are extremely important to
		secure users. For example one section is setting a password policy so Users
		cannot set unsecure passwords.
	</p>
	<p>Secondly, in the LSP you will find lockout policies and even service policies
		that you can modify. Fortunately through a couple of years of experience we 
		have built and be shown a template to use for competition. Bare in mind that 
		the settings could change based on the round and the year of the competition.
	</p>
	<p>For reference of what you need to do for the local security policy go to this page:
		to get more details on what exactly needs to be done.
