    <h3 id="AB">CHAPTER 1 - Absolute Basics</h3>
    <p>The absolute basics are needed for you to become a proper and prepared competitor. First off, a few things about
        Cybertitans. Cybertitans is about teamwork and dedication to get things complete to accomplish securing a 
        computer. The competition also is the fall into the spring if you qualify through the first couple of rounds.
        The goal sounds simple but it can become complicated the more that you become involved. Which works in two ways,
        you can take the competition as serious as you want, but you can also make the competition more challenging. 
    </p>

    <p>The first step is understanding what you are being thrown into. Remember you want to fix issues as efficiently as 
        possible. Once you have opened the Image, you will need to read the README which is a text file that is on the 
        desktop. This file is crucial since it gives the foundational information about what you need to work on. 
    </p>

    <p>Once skimmed through the file, here are some suggestions to do with the information:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Make note of anything important. There is a specific section that you might have to look at.</li>
        <li>Move onto the Forensic Questions, which might contain information that you can find in the README.</li>
        <li>Look around on the system but don't change anything until you are comfortable of what you are looking at.</li>
    </ol>

    <h4>Forensic Questions</h4>
    <p>These questions are designed specifically for the certain Round that you are competiting in. The questions span 
        a lot of different areas. Earlier Rounds would be more likely, "What directory is this file in?" Which then can 
        go up to finding hashes of certain files. It all depends on which Round you're on.
    </p>

    <h4>Purpose</h4>
    <p>This is built to challenge you. Which you can make harder and easier on yourself with the actions you do with your
        team. Building and spending time with your team can really be beneficial to knowing exactly what who needs what
        support. Or vice versa. It's about competiting but it's about teamwork and having fun with the people around you.
    </p>

    <h4>Recap</h4>
    <p>Cybertitans requires teamwork, and to communicate with your teammates. Once on the image, check for information.
        Information is vital. Answer some questions about your machine. Have fun with the competition.
    </p>


    <h3 id="P">SECTION 1.1 - Points</h3>
    <p>One image has 100 points scattered around the entire computer. These points are anywhere and everywhere.</p>

    <p>A few places these might be:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Forensic Questions -- (These give anywhere from 8-12 points EACH)</li>
        <li>Users -- (These give anywhere from 2-5 points EACH)</li>
        <li>Updates -- (These give anywhere from 5-20 points)</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Points are what the whole competition is all about. However there are some that you should actually avoid
        until a certain point of time in the competition. These would include difficult tasks. Anything you can't 
        do in 10 minutes or less should be pushed until you have done everything else. UNLESS IT REQUIRES YOU TO 
        DO SUCH THING IMEDIATELY.
    </p>
    <p>Typically you will start on an Image, having read the README, you will start with zero points. Your first stop should
        be one of the these:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Users and Groups</li>
        <li>Scripts</li>
        <li>Terminal</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The issue when coming into a competition is mapping out all of the places you need to go to, to gather the points.
        Making a call on if you should do a task should be considered based on the health of the team. Doing the easy points
        first could make the harder tasks easier, since now you have a bit on confidence. Scripts to do these tasks for you are
        also very beneficial to save time and make sure nothing is left behind. 
    </p>
    <p>The more complicated points should come after the following has been finished:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Basic Points Completed</li>
        <li>Updates</li>
        <li>Forensic Questions (At least the ones that could be completed)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>It should be left to either the person at the computer or the captain to decide when to go onto the more difficult paths.
        All of that though, isn't the issue. It's the time that it takes to solve the issue, since if you ready to sink two hours
        into a difficult you have to make sure that you are going to get something out of it. 
    </p>

    <h4>Recap</h4>
    <p>Get the easiest points first, don't try the difficult tasks unless you can solve them quickly. Set the groundwork before
        moving onto the complicated things. Make the decision when the time comes on what fixes you can do. Make scripts to make 
        the initial easy portion much easier.
    </p>

    <h3 id="G">SECTION 1.2 - Gameplan</h3>
    <p>The next thing your team and even yourself needs to do is develop a gameplan. A simple gameplan can help the team stay on
        track and even an actual pad they can write on make it easier to visualize what's going on.
    </p>
    <p>Setting up the gameplan will differ from team to team. The following are suggested for your plans:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>What to do with the README.
            Sometimes, the README will have a different objective than what you are used to. Able to adapt will be key.
        </li>
        <li>When to update?
            Certain services or programs will only update with a package manager rather than doing it automatically.
            Planning on updates while eating or researching something else would be advized.
        </li>
        <li>Focusing on what, and when?
            With the whole team setup, you will have multiple people working on different things all the time. You shouldn't have
            the entire team all dialed in on one task. (Case by case)
        </li>
    </ul>

    <p>You should expect that things will not always go to plan. This is completely normal, and is apart of the plan. Depending
        on which Round you are currently competiting in, you will find the image is designed to screw up any plan you had from
        the start. This could be in the form of a new method for points, to disabling access to a certain app. The twists are to
        be expected and adapting in the most important thing to do.
    </p>

    <p>For Bluez Stars there will be something physical that will be at competition that can be munipulated. This will represent
        our gameplan. Once laid out, it will be a little easier to picture the situation rather than trying to read words that
        you cannot change. Making sure the roles for each member is set and they are ready to go.
    </p>

    <h4>Recap</h4>
    <p>Plan accordingly, things are going to change and you need to be ready for it.</p>

    <h3 id="TR">SECTION 1.3 - Team Roles</h3>
    <p>Each team will have a maximum of five members at one time competiting. This is the limit according to the Cyberpatriot
        rules. This gives a whole bunch of combinations that you can have with your team. It will depend on what sort of people
        that you have on your team but the team will have at least one person on each machine with a dedicated member doing 
        the Cisco portion of the competition.
    </p>

    <p>Example: Bluez Stars Setup</p>

    <p>My team will have a certain compostition that is based of the Hypernova suggested setup.</p>
    <p>The team will consist of:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>TWO (2) Windows Competitors</li>
        <p>These competitors will be working on the Server and Windows 10 images, trading off of each other since the 
            interface can be similar. Hopefully, they will be able to aid each other and cover the entire Windows 
            department.
        </p>
        <li>TWO (2) Linux Competitors</li>
        <p>These competitors are responsible for working on the Linux images. However since there is only one image,
            I have plans to be able to set a competitor with skills for the Windows machines, in case something
            were to happen.
        </p>
        <li>ONE (1) Cisco Competitor</li>
        <p>This competitor is working on the Cisco Packet Tracer section of the competition. The role is going to also
            be a jack-of-all-trades player that has a pocket of experience with all of the images. 
        </p>
    </ul>
    <p>The real purpose of setting up team roles is to make sure that each person knows what they are going to be setup with,
        so it's not a shock to see the interface on competition day. Though, considering your team roles will also need you to
        consider the people you are putting into those roles. Knowing your teammates and their strong suits is key to setting
        up and the format of your team.
    </p>

    <h3 id="CPT">SECTION 1.4 - Cisco Packet Tracer</h3>
    <p>Mentioning the Cisco competitor, giving more information on what exactly Cisco is, might be useful. Cisco Packet Tracer
        is a program designed by Cisco to examine networks but in a virtual environment. The whole purpose is to create a network
        with different devices such as routers, computers, switches, and to examine certain activity when you send information 
        between them. 
    </p>
    <p>Being a Cisco competitor requires two things. First, you need to be knowledgable about how to work Cisco Packet Tracer,
        and second, able to learn quickly during competition. The second point is important because you are given resources
        at the start of the competition and you need to learn and apply it onto the virtual environment that it will supply you 
        with.
    </p>
    <p>Fortunately, there are many ways to learn and use Cisco Packet Tracer. If you are the competitor that is competiting 
        in the Cisco challenges, you require a Netacad account. It's free to create an account and using your school email 
        is the most successful to use. What the Netacad account comes with, is the ability to download and install Cisco
        Packet Tracer onto your own system. 
    </p>
    <p>To effectively learn how to use Cisco Packet Tracer, Cyberpatriot offers a course on it, as well you can find tutorials
        online on how to use the environment. The difficult part of being a Cisco competitor is learning on the spot. Learning
        beforehand, like the tools and configuring certain aspects of the program is the most important to learn.
    </p>
    <p>To choose your Cisco competitor or to be your teams competitor, make sure that you have a good grasp on the program. 
        After finding out at the end of the 23-24 season that Canadian teams can actually compete using Cisco. So the 
        experience of Cisco is a little low but with the help of every other team we can improve quickly. Hopefully we can squeeze
        some more points and put ourselves ahead.
